# Credits Plugin
Allows third-party image attributions to be added for the OctoberCMS backend. It provides a mechanism for displaying attributions for images used in the backend, e.g. SVG's used for the navigation menu. Attributions are displayed in a Credits widget on the dashboard page. 

### Instructions
Add any attribution code to the Image Attributions section of the backend Credits setting.

Enable the Credits dashboard widget, which will list all the image attributions on the dashboard page.
